 - Query.ByKeys: repository should remove keys from query that are already loaded
 - artist{albums,albums} should fail
 - workspace.remove() with expansion? or what about 1-n relations?
 - checking query type by "instanceof" kinda sucks. consider using discriminated union approach.
 - create a query cache that handles checking if a query can be loaded from workspace or not
