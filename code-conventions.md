# code style
in addition to the tslint rules, the following should apply:
* private class members are prefixed with _
* every getter/function must specify a return type
* use typed arg objects as arguments whenever appropiate
    * increases readability/usability if there are multiple arguments
    * increases backwards compatibility when you add optional arguments

# git commit message prefixes
a ! should be suffixed to a prefix to denote a breaking change
## **add**:

## **mod**:

* code guidelines are applied (e.g. tslint rules, file naming conventions, etc.)
* comments to illustrate functionality
* unused files/functions are removed
